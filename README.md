# Image Object Detection with Azure AI Custom Vision

A comprehensive Python notebook series demonstrating end-to-end object detection using Azure AI Custom Vision service. This project shows how to import labeled datasets, train custom object detection models, and deploy them for inference.

## 🎯 Overview
This repository contains two Python notebooks that guide you through the complete workflow of building an object detection solution with Azure Custom Vision:

- Notebook 1: Download Images Files and Labels - Data preparation and import
- Notebook 2: Azure AI Custom Vision for Object Detection - Model training and deployment

Azure Custom Vision is a cognitive service that enables you to build custom computer vision models without requiring deep machine learning expertise. It's perfect for detecting specific objects in images tailored to your business needs.
